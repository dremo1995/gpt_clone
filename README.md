# GPT CLone

### Description
I built this project using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used the OpenAI API and use ExpressJS as the backend framework. I built this to practice using public API's and improve my knowledge of emerging technolgies. 

It is a simple project, but I learned how to use the OpenAI API and practice my skills with JavaScript
